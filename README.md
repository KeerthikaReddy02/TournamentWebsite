# Tournament Website
Football is a suspense filled sport that causes a lot of excitement for players and audiences. Therefore, we have built a  tournament-hosting website. The goal of our project is to provide easy access to students to play in a game and host one, provide a platform for students to watch a game, and help students find teammates with common interests in football. Our project's main client is the VIT football club. The club can make use of our website to host tournaments. In addition, the college’s physical department can also make use of the website for organizing sports events and streamlining the registration process.

Students with full teams can sign up with their entire teams, and students who don’t have team members but want to participate can use the website to join a team. Users can log in as a host, players, or guests. As a host, he/she can schedule time, venue, number of tournaments, etc. Players can choose to join a game of their liking by providing contact details. Guests can join to watch the game based on their liking. 

The Frontend of the website is made using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap framework.
The Backend of the website is made using Node JS, Express JS, and MongoDB for database.
